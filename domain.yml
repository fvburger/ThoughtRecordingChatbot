      Welcome! Cool that you're here. I'm Luca. I'm a chatbot designed to help you regularly complete thought records. I'm still new to the job, so it's important that you realize that you should not interpret anything I say as a diagnosis. Nonetheless, I hope I can be useful to you. Enough about me, how are you doing?

  utter_good_fb2:
  - text: I'm glad to hear that. In today's session, you will be asked to do at least one thought record but unlike in the first session, there will not be any scenarios given. Instead, you should pick a recent situation from your own life that caused you to feel a strong, negative emotion. After the first thought record, you may do as many additional ones as you would like. To give you some room to do more thought records if you would like, you will be reimbursed for 20 minutes for both the task and the short questionnaire that follows. The questionnaire should take at most 5 minutes.
  utter_bad_fb:
  - text: That's too bad.
  utter_bad_fb2:

In today's session, you will be asked to do at least one thought record but unlike in the first session, there will not be any scenarios given. Instead, you should pick a recent situation from your own life that caused you to feel a strong, negative emotion.

      Alright, let's get started. Your task will be to complete thought records with my help. Thought records are a means to better understand why you respond the way you do to negative events. They do this by uncovering thinking patterns. If you do thought records regularly, you might come to see that the same types of situations make you feel bad and that this is because you hold certain beliefs about yourself, the world, or the future.

      Wow, ok, then you're not starting from scratch. See today's session then as a way of jogging your memory.
  utter_uninformed:
  - text: |
      No worries. That's exactly what this practice session is for.
  utter_automatic_thoughts:
  - text: |
      Automatic thoughts are verbal statements or mental images that pop up in our head in response to an event. This happens automatically and without conscious effort! Automatic thoughts are neither questions nor interjections, but the implications behind them. For example, if you are asked to give a presentation with only ten minutes to prepare and your first thought is 'Uh!' (interjection), the actual automatic thought might be something along the lines of 'I do not feel competent.' Similarly, it is not the thought in the form of a question that elicits emotions but rather the implicit answer we have to the question. For example, if you do not succeed at something and your first thought is 'Why can I never reach my goals?', it is probably the implicit answer of 'I am a failure' that causes sadness or disappointment. Please keep in mind that automatic thoughts are neither interjections nor questions but statements in sentence form when you are asked to state your automatic thoughts later, since the downward arrow technique might otherwise not work.
  utter_dat:
  - text: |
      The main idea behind doing thought records regularly is to learn to recognize thought patterns. According to cognitive theory, the automatic thoughts are triggered by deep-rooted personal beliefs (core beliefs) that we hold about ourselves, the world, or the future. Such a belief may be 'I am unlovable.' The downward arrow technique is designed to help us drill down to the core belief starting from the automatic thought. It consists of repeatedly asking the same question again, kind of like children always asking 'why?', until we reach a point where we start to repeat ourselves or feel like our answers are becoming ridiculous.
  utter_task:
  - text: |
      In today's session, we will do two thought records based on scenarios (I will give you a situation and you have to 
      imagine yourself in the situation). In the second session, you will be asked to choose situations from your own life. 
      A couple of important general pointers to keep in mind: 
      1. try to be brief in your answers (keep them to one or two sentences), 
      2. there are no right or wrong answers as everyone is unique. However, the researchers will later check if your answers were coherent and retain the right to exclude you if not,
      3. I'm only a computer algorithm. You should not interpret anything I say as a diagnosis!

If you expect an example to clarify things, you can also see the example thought record from the instructions again, the one including the downward arrow technique.
